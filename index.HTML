      <h2>about me:</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, my name is Megan Gao! I am an undergrad at UNC-Chapel Hill, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science & Economics.
      </p>
      <p>
      I have a strong passion for data analytics and market research, particularly in how economic trends shape industries and consumer behavior. I love exploring datasets to uncover patterns and derive meaningful insights that drive strategic decision-making.
      </p>
      <p>
      On the computer science side, my focus lies in front-end development, where I enjoy crafting intuitive and engaging user interfaces. My interest in UI/UX design stems from a desire to create seamless and visually appealing digital experiences that enhance usability and accessibility.
      </p>
      <p>
      With a unique combination of analytical thinking and creative problem-solving, I bridge the gap between data-driven insights and user-centered design. Whether it's building interactive web applications or analyzing market trends, I strive to make a meaningful impact through technology and economic research.
      </p>
